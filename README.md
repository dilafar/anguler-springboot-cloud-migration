### External Secret Installation
#### To install the External Secret on GKE:

### 1. Create a Google Cloud IAM Service Account for External Secrets
- A new IAM service account is created for External Secrets to securely access Google Secret Manager.

### 2. Assign Secret Manager Access Role
- The IAM service account needs permission to access secrets stored in Google Secret Manager. The `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` role is assigned to allow retrieval of secrets.

### 3. Create a Kubernetes Namespace
- A dedicated namespace is created to manage External Secrets components separately from other workloads.

### 4. Create a Kubernetes Service Account
- A Kubernetes service account is created in the `external-secret-ns` namespace, which will be linked to the Google Cloud IAM service account for authentication.

### 5. Bind Workload Identity for External Secrets
- The Kubernetes service account is bound to the IAM service account, enabling External Secrets to securely access Google Secret Manager using Workload Identity.

### 6. Generate and Store IAM Service Account Key (Optional)
- A service account key is created and stored as a Kubernetes secret. This allows External Secrets to authenticate with Google Secret Manager.

### 7. Annotate the Kubernetes Service Account
- Annotations are added to the Kubernetes service account to associate it with the corresponding Google Cloud IAM service account, ensuring seamless authentication.

### 8. Install External Secrets via Helm
- The External Secrets Helm chart is added, and the deployment is installed with the necessary annotations and namespace settings. This ensures that External Secrets is correctly configured to fetch secrets from 
  Google Secret Manager.

### 9. Verify the External Secrets Deployment
- After deploying External Secrets, all related Kubernetes resources are checked to confirm successful installation and proper functionality.

### 10. Configure ClusterSecretStore for External Secrets
- A `ClusterSecretStore` resource is created, specifying Google Cloud Secret Manager as the provider. This configuration allows External Secrets to retrieve secrets from Google Secret Manager securely.

### 11. Define an ExternalSecret Resource
- An `ExternalSecret` resource is created, specifying how secrets should be fetched from Google Secret Manager and stored within Kubernetes. This ensures that applications can retrieve secrets dynamically 
  without manually managing them.


### Domain & DNS Management

### 1. Domain Registration and Hosting
- The domain is registered on Google Cloud and hosted using Cloud DNS. This allows Kubernetes External DNS to manage DNS records dynamically in a cloud-native manner.

### 2. Using Kubernetes ExternalDNS for Dynamic DNS Management
- Kubernetes ExternalDNS is configured to automatically create, update, and delete DNS records based on Kubernetes ingress and service resources, ensuring a cloud-agnostic approach.

### 3. IAM Policy and Service Account Setup
- To handle Cloud DNS access securely, an IAM service account is created along with the necessary IAM policy. The appropriate IAM role (`roles/dns.admin`) is assigned to this service account, enabling -     
  ExternalDNS to manage DNS records.

### 4. Configuring ExternalDNS Deployment
- The ExternalDNS deployment is configured to use the Google Cloud IAM service account. This allows ExternalDNS to interact with Cloud DNS and manage DNS records dynamically through Kubernetes ingress or service 
  resources.

### 5. Managing DNS Records with Google Cloud LoadBalancer
- Since the application uses a Google Cloud LoadBalancer, ExternalDNS manages DNS records by monitoring and updating Kubernetes ingress resources, ensuring proper routing and accessibility.

### 6. Enabling TLS Certificates for Secure Connections
- TLS certificates are provisioned using Google Managed SSL Certificates. These certificates are integrated with Kubernetes ingress resources to enable secure HTTPS connections for applications running on GKE.

### 7. Deploying External DNS
- The final step involves deploying the ExternalDNS application in the Kubernetes cluster. This ensures that DNS records are dynamically managed and kept up to date based on Kubernetes resources.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation
### Starting services locally without Docker

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dilafar/anguler-springboot-aws-migration.git
cd anguler-springboot-aws-migration
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

#### üîπ Build & Run Locally

```sh
cd employeemanager
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup (Angular)

#### üîπ Install Dependencies & Start

```sh
cd employeemanagerfrontend
npm install
ng serve --open
```

### Starting services locally with docker-compose

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start All Services

#### üîπ Run the following command to start the application:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
The -d flag runs the services in detached mode.

![docker-compose-up](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13172c0b-ef56-48f6-a3d4-568025f24736)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Running Containers

#### üîπ Check the status of running containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Application

```sh
Frontend (Client UI): https://localhost
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Stop Services

#### üîπ To stop all running containers:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### üîç Additional Notes

- The MySQL container has a health check configured to ensure it is ready before the backend services start.
- Nginx serves as a reverse proxy to route traffic between services.
- The backend services depend on the MySQL service to be healthy before they can start.
- The frontend communicates via Nginx, which handles routing and SSL termination.

## Database Configuration

### üè¢ Default Database (HSQLDB)
By default, the Employee Management application uses an **in-memory database (HSQLDB)**. This database is automatically populated with data at startup. 

### üõ†Ô∏è MySQL Configuration
If a persistent database is required, the application can be configured to use **MySQL**. The necessary **Connector/J (MySQL JDBC Driver)** dependency is already included in the `pom.xml` file.

### üöÄ Start a MySQL Database with Docker
You can start a MySQL database using **Docker** with the following command:

```sh
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic \  
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic \  
    -p 3306:3306 \  
    mysql:5.7.8
```

Alternatively, you can install **MySQL Community Server 5.7 GA** manually from the official [MySQL downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

### üîß Configuring MySQL for Production
For **production deployment**, it is recommended to use **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)** to ensure scalability and reliability.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up an AWS RDS Database
- Create an **Amazon RDS instance** with **MySQL** as the database engine.
- Configure **username, password, and host** details.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Update `application.yml` with RDS Configuration
Modify the `application.yml` file to include the **AWS RDS** database configuration:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://<RDS_HOST>:3306/employeemanager
    username: <RDS_USERNAME>
    password: <RDS_PASSWORD>
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Application
Run the application with the configured **AWS RDS** database:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Now, the Employee Management application is connected to a persistent **AWS RDS MySQL database** and ready for production deployment. üöÄ
