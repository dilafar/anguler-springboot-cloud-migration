# Full CI/CD pipelines for employee management application, a Java-based dynamic web application with a database.

## Overview

This project is a full-stack Employee Management System developed using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend. It follows **DevSecOps** principles and is deployed on **AWS** using Kubernetes.

## üõ† Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Spring Boot** (REST API)
- **MySQL** (AWS RDS)
- **Maven** (Build tool)

### Frontend

- **Angular** (UI Framework)

### DevOps Tools

- **CI/CD & Configuration Management**: Jenkins, Ansible, GitHub
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize, Docker, Docker Compose
- **Security & Compliance**: Cosign, HashiCorp Vault, TruffleHog, Checkstyle, NodeJsScan, SonarQube, Semgrep, Trivy, Kubescape, Hadolint, Retire.js, Maven Dependency Check, OWASP ZAP, Open Policy Agent (OPA), DefectDojo
- **Artifact & Dependency Management**: Nexus Repository, Maven, ArtifactHub
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Prometheus, Grafana, Alert Manager
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform
- **Continuous Deployment & GitOps**: ArgoCD

### gcp Services Used

- **Networking & Load Balancing**: cloud load balancing, cloud dns, google managed ssl sertificate, VPC networks, cloud external ip address
- **Compute & Container Management**: gke, Compute Engine
- **Storage & Secrets Management**: cloud sql, secret manager
- **Container Registry & CDN**: google artifact repository, cloud cdn

### External Secret Installation
#### To install the External Secret on GKE:

- An IAM policy was created to grant the necessary permissions.
- An IAM service account was created and linked to the policy.
- The AWS Load Balancer Controller was installed using Helm, utilizing the created service account.

### Domain & DNS Management

- The domain was registered on Google Cloud and hosted on AWS Route 53.
- Kubernetes ExternalDNS was used to manage DNS records dynamically, ensuring a cloud-agnostic approach.
- To handle Route 53 access, an IAM policy and IAM service account were created, assigning the necessary IAM role to the Kubernetes service account.
- The ExternalDNS deployment was configured with the service account, allowing DNS record management through Kubernetes ingress or service resources.
- Since the application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB), ExternalDNS manages DNS records via Kubernetes ingress resources.
- TLS certificates were provisioned using AWS Certificate Manager, ensuring secure HTTPS connections through Kubernetes ingress resources.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation
### Starting services locally without Docker

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dilafar/anguler-springboot-aws-migration.git
cd anguler-springboot-aws-migration
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

#### üîπ Build & Run Locally

```sh
cd employeemanager
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Setup (Angular)

#### üîπ Install Dependencies & Start

```sh
cd employeemanagerfrontend
npm install
ng serve --open
```

### Starting services locally with docker-compose

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start All Services

#### üîπ Run the following command to start the application:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
The -d flag runs the services in detached mode.

![docker-compose-up](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13172c0b-ef56-48f6-a3d4-568025f24736)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Running Containers

#### üîπ Check the status of running containers:

```sh
docker ps
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Application

```sh
Frontend (Client UI): https://localhost
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Stop Services

#### üîπ To stop all running containers:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### üîç Additional Notes

- The MySQL container has a health check configured to ensure it is ready before the backend services start.
- Nginx serves as a reverse proxy to route traffic between services.
- The backend services depend on the MySQL service to be healthy before they can start.
- The frontend communicates via Nginx, which handles routing and SSL termination.

## Database Configuration

### üè¢ Default Database (HSQLDB)
By default, the Employee Management application uses an **in-memory database (HSQLDB)**. This database is automatically populated with data at startup. 

### üõ†Ô∏è MySQL Configuration
If a persistent database is required, the application can be configured to use **MySQL**. The necessary **Connector/J (MySQL JDBC Driver)** dependency is already included in the `pom.xml` file.

### üöÄ Start a MySQL Database with Docker
You can start a MySQL database using **Docker** with the following command:

```sh
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic \  
    -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic \  
    -p 3306:3306 \  
    mysql:5.7.8
```

Alternatively, you can install **MySQL Community Server 5.7 GA** manually from the official [MySQL downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

### üîß Configuring MySQL for Production
For **production deployment**, it is recommended to use **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)** to ensure scalability and reliability.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up an AWS RDS Database
- Create an **Amazon RDS instance** with **MySQL** as the database engine.
- Configure **username, password, and host** details.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Update `application.yml` with RDS Configuration
Modify the `application.yml` file to include the **AWS RDS** database configuration:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://<RDS_HOST>:3306/employeemanager
    username: <RDS_USERNAME>
    password: <RDS_PASSWORD>
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Application
Run the application with the configured **AWS RDS** database:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Now, the Employee Management application is connected to a persistent **AWS RDS MySQL database** and ready for production deployment. üöÄ
